# Entree Finder

Entree Finder is a dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that helps users find a Dinner recipe by searching the main ingredient!

Users can search for a recipe using keywords. Keywords include cuisines, diets, ingredients, calories, total fats, spices, and more!

I would like this to be open source as a learning experience for everyone. Feel free to contribute and share ideas!
